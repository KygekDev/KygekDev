# KygekDev Private Support

If you get to this page, chances are you were redirected from https://kygekdev.github.io/private-support. This page will explain about private support from KygekDev, both for PocketMine-MP plugins and other things.

### WARNING

Only send friend requests to KygekDev if you have a strong reason to do so (such as reporting vulnerabilities, staff DM-ing, etc.). When KygekDev accepts your friend request, he will ask you for a strong reason to why you sent a friend request to him. Failing to give a strong reason will result in a **friend removal**. Friend requests may be closed **permanently** if users keep abusing the friend requests feature without any strong reasons. If that happens, every user **must** notify KygekDev in a public Discord server by mentioning and providing a strong reason to why the user wants to send him a friend request, otherwise all unknown friend requests will be **ignored**.

## Private Support for PocketMine-MP Plugins

Unfortunately, we do not offer private support for PocketMine-MP plugins help, either plugins by KygekTeam or not. We are trying to provide best support, yet most of our work are done voluntarily and free of any costs. Because of this, we do not have exact response duration. Moreover, there might be some questions that we cannot help because of various reasons. However, you can join the [KygekTeam Discord server](https://discord.gg/CXtqUZv) and get some benefits:

- Support in the KygekTeam Discord server is favored over private support.
- More likely to get answers from questions, as there are many experienced users.
- Support from other KygekTeam staffs, in case of questions about plugins by KygekTeam.

If you keep trying to ask for private support, we will send you a link to the KygekTeam Discord server and ignore future messages which related to PocketMine-MP plugin help.

An exception is made for important circumstances which requires private support for PocketMine-MP plugins. If you have one, kindly send a friend request to KygekDev, wait KygekDev to accept or call KygekDev in a mutual server (please follow the server rules), and explain that you need private support because of an important circumstance.

## Private Support for Commissions

I understand that there are many Minecraft server owners that have requested commissions from me. Unfortunately, I do not open for any commissions as of now, for some reasons. I do apologize for anyone that have tried requesting commissions from me. Even so, I can help you to do simple tasks (e.g. making or modifying simple plugins, upgrading your server's PHP binary) for your Minecraft servers at no cost. Alternatively, you can request me to make a more complex plugin, but the plugin needs to be open-source and easy to use by anyone. Please note that if you do that, the plugin may take more time to finish depending on the complexity of the plugin.

From now on, anyone that tries to request commission from me will be given a link to this page.

## Private Support for Other Things

If it's about programming or coding, we strongly suggest you to join the [KygekDev community Discord server](https://discord.gg/TstDS9jZf7). However, private support may be offered if you really need special help or for any other important circumstances.
