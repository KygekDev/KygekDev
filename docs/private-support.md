## Private Support for PocketMine-MP Plugins

Unfortunately, we do not offer private support for PocketMine-MP plugins help, either plugins by KygekTeam or not. We are trying to provide best support, yet most of our work are done voluntarily and free of any costs. Because of this, we do not have exact response duration. Moreover, there might be some questions that we cannot help because of various reasons. However, you can join the [KygekTeam Discord server](https://discord.gg/CXtqUZv) and get some benefits:

- Support in the KygekTeam Discord server is favored over private support.
- More likely to get answers from questions, as there are many experienced users.
- Support from other KygekTeam staffs, in case of questions about plugins by KygekTeam.

If you keep trying to ask for private support, we will send you a link to the KygekTeam Discord server and ignore future messages which related to PocketMine-MP plugin help.

An exception is made for commissions and other important circumstances which requires private support for PocketMine-MP plugins. If you have one, kindly send a friend request to KygekDev, wait KygekDev to accept or call KygekDev in a mutual server (please follow the server rules), and explain that you need private support because of an important circumstance.

## Private Support for Other Things

If it's about programming or coding, we strongly suggest you to join the [KygekDev community Discord server](https://discord.gg/TstDS9jZf7). However, private support may be offered if you really need help, asking for commissions or any other important circumstances.
