# Using Images on KygekDev's UI Plugins

This is a documentation made by KygekDev for guides on using an image beside buttons in some KygekTeam's plugins (e.g. KygekJoinUI).

## Modes

There are 2 buttons image modes available: [**Link**](#images-from-links) or [**Texture Pack**](#images-from-texture-packs).

## Images from Links

If you want to add images from link, you should follow the following rules so the images could load properly:

- Images **should use** the .png format (for compatibility reasons).
- Images **should be displayed** as raw (no HTML/CSS/JavaScript included or injected).
- Links **should include** "http://" or "https://".

Sometimes images don't load properly, if that's the case, you may have to open the status bar (Android) or press the Windows key (Windows 10) for the images to load. Other platforms, such as iOS, Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, etc haven't been tested.

## Images from Texture Packs

If you want to use image from texture pack, please visit https://github.com/KygekDev/default-textures for more info.
