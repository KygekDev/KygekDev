# Using Images on Kygekraqmak's UI Plugins

This is a documentation made by Kygekraqmak for guides on using an image beside buttons in some Kygekraqmak's plugins (e.g. KygekJoinUI).

## Modes

There are buttons image modes available: [**Link**](https://github.com/Kygekraqmak/Kygekraqmak/blob/master/docs/using-images-kygekraqmak-plugins.md#images-from-links) or [**Texture Pack**](https://github.com/Kygekraqmak/Kygekraqmak/blob/master/docs/using-images-kygekraqmak-plugins.md#images-from-texture-packs).

## Images from Links

If you want to add images from link, you should follow some rules as seen below so the images could load:

- Images **should use** the .png format (for compatibility reasons).
- Images **should be** at least 160 x 160 px in size.
- Images **should be displayed** as raw (no HTML/CSS/JavaScript included or injected).
- Links **should include** "http://" or "https://".

Sometimes the image will not load properly, you may have to open status bar or press Windows key. ~~For image example, please visit https://kygekraqmak.github.io/downloads/css/test.png.~~

## Images from Texture Packs

If you want to use image from texture pack, please visit https://github.com/Kygekraqmak/default-textures for more info.
